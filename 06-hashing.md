49. Group Anagrams
https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Example 2:
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
Constraints:
1 <= strs.length <= 104
0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
```
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        groups = defaultdict(list)
        for s in strs:
            key = "".join(sorted(s))
            groups[key].append(s)
        
        return groups.values()

2260. Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-consecutive-cards-to-pick-up/description/
You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the value of the ith card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have the same value.

Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards. If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.

Example 1:
Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4] is also optimal.

Example 2:
Input: cards = [1,0,5,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no way to pick up a set of consecutive cards that contain a pair of matching cards.

Constraints:
1 <= cards.length <= 105
0 <= cards[i] <= 106
```
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:

2342. Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits
https://leetcode.com/problems/max-sum-of-a-pair-with-equal-sum-of-digits/description/
You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of positive integers. You can choose two indices i and j, such that i != j, and the sum of digits of the number nums[i] is equal to that of nums[j].

Return the maximum value of nums[i] + nums[j] that you can obtain over all possible indices i and j that satisfy the conditions.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [18,43,36,13,7]
Output: 54
Explanation: The pairs (i, j) that satisfy the conditions are:
- (0, 2), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 9, and their sum is 18 + 36 = 54.
- (1, 4), both numbers have a sum of digits equal to 7, and their sum is 43 + 7 = 50.
So the maximum sum that we can obtain is 54.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [10,12,19,14]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no two numbers that satisfy the conditions, so we return -1.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
```
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maximumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

771. Jewels and Stones
https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/description/
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0

Constraints:
1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.
```
```python
class Solution:
    def numJewelsInStones(self, J: 'str', S: 'str') -> 'int':
        J = set(J)
        ct = 0

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false

Constraints:
1 <= pattern.length <= 300
pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
1 <= s.length <= 3000
s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in s are separated by a single space.

791. Custom Sort String
https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/description/
You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.

Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

Example 1:
Input:   order = "cba", s = "abcd" 
Output:   "cbad" 
Explanation:  "a", "b", "c" appear in order, so the order of "a", "b", "c" should be "c", "b", and "a".
Since "d" does not appear in order, it can be at any position in the returned string. "dcba", "cdba", "cbda" are also valid outputs.

Example 2:
Input:   order = "bcafg", s = "abcd"
Output:   "bcad"
Explanation: The characters "b", "c", and "a" from order dictate the order for the characters in s. The character "d" in s does not appear in order, so its position is flexible.

Following the order of appearance in order, "b", "c", and "a" from s should be arranged as "b", "c", "a". "d" can be placed at any position since it's not in order. The output "bcad" correctly follows this rule. Other arrangements like "bacd" or "bcda" would also be valid, as long as "b", "c", "a" maintain their order.

Constraints:
1 <= order.length <= 26
1 <= s.length <= 200
order and s consist of lowercase English letters.
All the characters of order are unique.

1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close
https://leetcode.com/problems/determine-if-two-strings-are-close/description/
Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
For example, abcde -> aecdb
Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.
For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into a's)
You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.

Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"

Example 2:
Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.

Example 3:
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"
Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"

Constraints:
1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 105
word1 and word2 contain only lowercase English letters.
