# arrays and strings
## Two Pointers

Start the pointers at the edges of the input. Move them towards each other until they meet.
1. Start one pointer at the first index 0 and the other pointer at the last index input.length - 1.
2. Use a while loop until the pointers are equal to each other.
3. At each iteration of the loop, move the pointers towards each other. This means either increment the pointer that started at the first index, decrement the pointer that started at the last index, or both. Deciding which pointers to move will depend on the problem we are trying to solve.

```
function fn(arr)
left = 0
right = len(n)-1
while left < right:
    # do some logic here depending on the problem
    # dop some more logic here to decide on one of the following
        1. left ++
        2. right --
        3. both left++ and right--
```


Example 1: Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise.

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward as backward. That means, after reversing it, it is still the same string. For example: "abcdcba", or "racecar".

```python
def check_if_palindrome(s):
    left = 0
    right = len(s) - 1

    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    
    return True
```

Given a sorted array of unique integers and a target integer, return true if there exists a pair of numbers that sum to target, false otherwise. This problem is similar to Two Sum. (In Two Sum, the input is not sorted).
```python
def check_for_target(nums, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left < right:
        # curr is the current sum
        curr = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if curr == target:
            return True
        if curr > target:
            right -= 1
        else:
            left += 1
    
    return False
```

Move along both inputs simultaneously until all elements have been checked.

Converting this idea into instructions:

1. Create two pointers, one for each iterable. Each pointer should start at the first index.
2. Use a while loop until one of the pointers reaches the end of its iterable.
3. At each iteration of the loop, move the pointers forward. This means incrementing either one of the pointers or both of the pointers. Deciding which pointers to move will depend on the problem we are trying to solve.
4. Because our while loop will stop when one of the pointers reaches the end, the other pointer will not be at the end of its respective iterable when the loop finishes. Sometimes, we need to iterate through all elements - if this is the case, you will need to write extra code here to make sure both iterables are exhausted.

```python
function fn(arr1, arr2):
    i = j = 0
    while i < arr1.length AND j < arr2.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        Do some more logic here to decide on one of the following:
            1. i++
            2. j++
            3. Both i++ and j++

    // Step 4: make sure both iterables are exhausted
    // Note that only one of these loops would run
    while i < arr1.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        i++

    while j < arr2.length:
        Do some logic here depending on the problem
        j++
```

Example 3: Given two sorted integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return a new array that combines both of them and is also sorted.

```python
def combine(arr1, arr2):
    # ans is the answer
    ans = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            ans.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            ans.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1
    
    while i < len(arr1):
        ans.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1
    
    while j < len(arr2):
        ans.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1
    
    return ans
```

Example 4: 392. Is Subsequence.

Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a sequence of characters that can be obtained by deleting some (or none) of the characters from the original string, while maintaining the relative order of the remaining characters. For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return i == len(s)
```

268. Missing Number
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

## Counting
Problem
```
Example 1: You are given a string s and an integer k. Find the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters.

For example, given s = "eceba" and k = 2, return 3. The longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters is "ece".
```
Answer:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def find_longest_substring(s, k):
    counts = defaultdict(int)
    left = ans = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        counts[s[right]] += 1
        while len(counts) > k:
            counts[s[left]] -= 1
            if counts[s[left]] == 0:
                del counts[s[left]]
            left += 1
        
        ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
    
    return ans
```

problem 2248
```
Example 2: 2248. Intersection of Multiple Arrays

Given a 2D array nums that contains n arrays of distinct integers, return a sorted array containing all the numbers that appear in all n arrays.

For example, given nums = [[3,1,2,4,5],[1,2,3,4],[3,4,5,6]], return [3, 4]. 3 and 4 are the only numbers that are in all arrays.
```
answer:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def intersection(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        for arr in nums:
            for x in arr:
                counts[x] += 1

        n = len(nums)
        ans = []
        for key in counts:
            if counts[key] == n:
                ans.append(key)
        
        return sorted(ans)
```
```
Example 3: 1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences

Given a string s, determine if all characters have the same frequency.

For example, given s = "abacbc", return true. All characters appear twice. Given s = "aaabb", return false. "a" appears 3 times, "b" appears 2 times. 3 != 2.
```
answer
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def areOccurrencesEqual(self, s: str) -> bool:
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        for c in s:
            counts[c] += 1
        
        frequencies = counts.values()
        return len(set(frequencies)) == 1
```

count the number of subarrays with an exact constraint
```
Example 4: 560. Subarray Sum Equals K

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, find the number of subarrays whose sum is equal to k.
```
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        counts[0] = 1
        ans = curr = 0

        for num in nums:
            curr += num
            ans += counts[curr - k]
            counts[curr] += 1
    
        return ans
```
Note:
We use curr to track the prefix sum.
At any index i, the sum up to i is curr. If there is an index j whose prefix is curr - k, then the sum of the subarray with elements from j + 1 to i is curr - (curr - k) = k.
Because the array can have negative numbers, the same prefix can occur multiple times. We use a hash map counts to track how many times a prefix has occurred.
At every index i, the frequency of curr - k is equal to the number of subarrays whose sum is equal to k that end at i. Add it to the answer.

```
Example 5: 1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays

Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k. Find the number of subarrays with exactly k odd numbers in them.

For example, given nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1], k = 3, the answer is 2. The subarrays with 3 odd numbers in them are [1, 1, 2, 1, 1] and [1, 1, 2, 1, 1].
```
```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def subarraySum(self,nums):
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        counts[0] =1
        ans = curr = 0
        for num in nums:
            curr+=num%2
            if curr
            ans += counts[curr-k]
            counts[curr]+=1

```

2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses
You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Note:

You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
 

Example 1:

Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
Example 2:

Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
 

Constraints:

1 <= matches.length <= 105
matches[i].length == 2
1 <= winneri, loseri <= 105
winneri != loseri
All matches[i] are unique.
```

When should you use A sliding window?
First, the problem will either explicitly or implicitly define criteria that make a subarray "valid". There are 2 components regarding what makes a subarray valid:

A constraint metric. This is some attribute of a subarray. It could be the sum, the number of unique elements, the frequency of a specific element, or any other attribute.
A numeric restriction on the constraint metric. This is what the constraint metric should be for a subarray to be considered valid.

Second, the problem will ask you to find valid subarrays in some way.

The most common task you will see is finding the best valid subarray. The problem will define what makes a subarray better than another. For example, a problem might ask you to find the longest valid subarray.

Another common task is finding the number of valid subarrays. We will take a look at this later in the article.
