206. Reverse Linked List
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description/
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:
Input: head = []
Output: []
Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
```python
def reverse_list(head):
    prev = None
    curr = head
    while curr:
        next_node = curr.next # first, make sure we don't lose the next node
        curr.next = prev      # reverse the direction of the pointer
        prev = curr           # set the current node to prev for the next node
        curr = next_node      # move on
    return prev
```

24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/description/
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100
```python
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Check edge case: linked list has 0 or 1 nodes, just return
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        dummy = head.next               # Step 5
        prev = None                     # Initialize for step 3
        while head and head.next:
            if prev:
                prev.next = head.next   # Step 4
            prev = head                 # Step 3

            next_node = head.next.next  # Step 2
            head.next.next = head       # Step 1

            head.next = next_node       # Step 6
            head = next_node            # Move to next pair (Step 3)
        return dummy

2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/description/
In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.
Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6. 
Example 2:
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7.
Example 3:
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 105
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def pairSum(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> int:

Output: [1,4,3,2,5]

Example 2:

2074. Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-even-length-groups/description/
You are given the head of a linked list.

The nodes in the linked list are sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). The length of a group is the number of nodes assigned to it. In other words,

The 1st node is assigned to the first group.
The 2nd and the 3rd nodes are assigned to the second group.
The 4th, 5th, and 6th nodes are assigned to the third group, and so on.
Note that the length of the last group may be less than or equal to 1 + the length of the second to last group.

Reverse the nodes in each group with an even length, and return the head of the modified linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [5,2,6,3,9,1,7,3,8,4]
Output: [5,6,2,3,9,1,4,8,3,7]
Explanation:
- The length of the first group is 1, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.
- The length of the third group is 3, which is odd, hence no reversal occurs.
- The length of the last group is 4, which is even, hence the nodes are reversed.

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,1,0,6]
Output: [1,0,1,6]
Explanation:
- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
- The length of the last group is 1. No reversal occurs.

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,1,0,6,5]
Output: [1,0,1,5,6]
Explanation:
- The length of the first group is 1. No reversal occurs.
- The length of the second group is 2. The nodes are reversed.
- The length of the last group is 2. The nodes are reversed.

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
0 <= Node.val <= 105
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/description/
In a linked list of size n, where n is even, the ith node (0-indexed) of the linked list is known as the twin of the (n-1-i)th node, if 0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1.

For example, if n = 4, then node 0 is the twin of node 3, and node 1 is the twin of node 2. These are the only nodes with twins for n = 4.
The twin sum is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

Example 1:
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 1 are the twins of nodes 3 and 2, respectively. All have twin sum = 6.
There are no other nodes with twins in the linked list.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is 6.

Example 2:
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The nodes with twins present in this linked list are:
- Node 0 is the twin of node 3 having a twin sum of 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node 1 is the twin of node 2 having a twin sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
Thus, the maximum twin sum of the linked list is max(7, 4) = 7.

Example 3:
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
There is only one node with a twin in the linked list having twin sum of 1 + 100000 = 100001.

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range [2, 105].
1 <= Node.val <= 105
