203. Remove LInked List Elements
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/description/
Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]Example 2:
Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
1 <= Node.val <= 50
0 <= val <= 50
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeElements(self, head: Optional[ListNode], val: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:

1290. Convert BInary Number in a Linked List to Integer
https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/description/
Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.
Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.
Example 1:
Input: head = [1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
Example 2:
Input: head = [0]
Output: 0
Constraints:
The Linked List is not empty.
Number of nodes will not exceed 30.
Each node's value is either 0 or 1.
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:

328. Odd Even Linked List
https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/description/
Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]

Example 2:
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 104].
-106 <= Node.val <= 106
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
```

707. Design Linked List
https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/description/
Design your implementation of the linked list. You can choose to use a singly or doubly linked list.
A node in a singly linked list should have two attributes: val and next. val is the value of the current node, and next is a pointer/reference to the next node.
If you want to use the doubly linked list, you will need one more attribute prev to indicate the previous node in the linked list. Assume all nodes in the linked list are 0-indexed.

Implement the MyLinkedList class:

MyLinkedList() Initializes the MyLinkedList object.
int get(int index) Get the value of the indexth node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1.
void addAtHead(int val) Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new node will be the first node of the linked list.
void addAtTail(int val) Append a node of value val as the last element of the linked list.
void addAtIndex(int index, int val) Add a node of value val before the indexth node in the linked list. If index equals the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.
void deleteAtIndex(int index) Delete the indexth node in the linked list, if the index is valid.

Example 1:
Input
["MyLinkedList", "addAtHead", "addAtTail", "addAtIndex", "get", "deleteAtIndex", "get"]
[[], [1], [3], [1, 2], [1], [1], [1]]
Output
[null, null, null, null, 2, null, 3]
Explanation
MyLinkedList myLinkedList = new MyLinkedList();
myLinkedList.addAtHead(1);
myLinkedList.addAtTail(3);
myLinkedList.addAtIndex(1, 2);    // linked list becomes 1->2->3
myLinkedList.get(1);              // return 2
myLinkedList.deleteAtIndex(1);    // now the linked list is 1->3
myLinkedList.get(1);              // return 3

Constraints:
0 <= index, val <= 1000
Please do not use the built-in LinkedList library.
At most 2000 calls will be made to get, addAtHead, addAtTail, addAtIndex and deleteAtIndex.
